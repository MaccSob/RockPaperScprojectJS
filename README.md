Rock/Paper/Scissors game made with JavaScript and HTML. One of the early projects from TOP curriculum. It keeps score of both players, and declares the winner after 5 rounds.


It was my very first project made with JS, therefore it took me a while to finish it, but I learned a lot in the process, and was pretty happy of myself in the end.
